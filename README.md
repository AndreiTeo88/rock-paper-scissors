Day 4 project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of the course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Pyhton Pro Bootcamp for 2021 presented by Dr. Angela Yu, the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. The course is available @ udemy/course/100-days-of-code/

Although this project is part of a course which was graduated by thousands of students, when the task is received you are starting from an almost blank file (you are provided only with the ASCII art).

There are multiple ways of finishing the project, so the chances of having 100% the same line of code as the teacher or other students is very low.

Slightly resemblances might appear here and there.
